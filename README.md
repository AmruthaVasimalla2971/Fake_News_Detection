# Aim 
Aim of this project is to detect fake news using machine learning algorithm.

# Requirements
  1. Jupyter Notebook/Colab
  2. Python3

# Technologies 
  * Machine Learning
  * Python3
  * Mathematics

# Launch
  1. Unzip the dataset given[news.zip]
  2. Save both the ipynb file and news.csv in the same folder.
  3. That's it you are ready to go and run the code.

# PassiveAggressiveClassifier
  * Generally Used for large scale learning.
  * One of the online learning algorithms.
  * In online learning algorithms,the input data comes in sequential order.
  * Machine learning model is updated step by step.
  * This is well used for fake news detection because data is being added every second if we consider twitter/any social media platform.
  * To dynamically read data from twitter continuously using online learning algorithm would be ideal since the data is huge.
  * Passive: If prediction is correct,keep the model do not make any changes.
  * Aggressive: If the prediction is incorrect, make changes to the model.
